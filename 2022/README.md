My code for the Advent Of Code 2022 programming puzzles.

# How to Use
1. Define *your* AoC API session key and User-Agent within `newday.py`
2. Run `newday.py`
    - creates a new directory for the defined day
    - creates dynamic `aoc_template.py` as `{dayX}.py`
    - creates an empty example file as `{dayX}.example`
    - downloads *your* data from AoC as `{dayX}.input`
3. Modify `{dayX}.py` to solve for the day's problem

**Successul Output of `{dayX}.py`**

# My Goal
Hoping to get at least 25 stars (1 star for solving each of two parts) of the 50 stars possible.

# My Status
Currently: 16 stars

:heavy_check_mark: Create a template script to build from each day --> make upgrades


:heavy_check_mark: Create a "new day" script that creates a directory, files, and gets input --> make upgrades


&#9744; Have `new_day.py` autopopulate `X.example` and `X.py` with AoC problem page's example data and test answers


# Why
Starting with a blank state because I need the practice. I'll try to post my daily solutions if I find the correct answer(s). In later days, I may spend some time cleaning up past solutions to more optimized or elegant alternate solutions.

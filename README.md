:heavy_check_mark: Create a template script to build from each day


:heavy_check_mark: Create a "new day" script that creates a directory, files, and gets input


# Why
Starting with a blank state because I need the practice. I'll try to post my daily solutions if I find the correct answer(s). In later days, I may spend some time cleaning up past solutions to more optimized or elegant alternate solutions.

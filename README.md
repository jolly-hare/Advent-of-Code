# Goal
Hoping to get at least 25 stars (1 star for solving each of two parts) of the 50 stars possible.

# Status
Currently: 0 stars

# Why
Starting with a blank state because I need the practice. I'll try to post my daily solutions if I find the correct answer(s). In later days, I may spend some time cleaning up past solutions to more optimized or elegant alternate solutions.
